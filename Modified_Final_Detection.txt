# Must know Detail Before Starting Project

Normal laptop wont Work fine for deep learning. Deep learning required GPU Processor .... 
But Tensor flow  help to convert CPU to GPU at some extend

We already have one environment in the jupyter notebook which fills with the other library so
its difficult to add tensorflow in it... So we have to creat new environment

# Craet New Environment

First open powershell of anaconda and run below cmd

conda create -n DeepLearning_cpu pip python=3.6    #it Will creat new Environment DeepLearning_cpu with python version 3.6

# Activate that Environment

activate DeepLearning_cpu

# To activate and Dactivate environment Following Command will be helpful

conda activate DeepLearning_cpu        # Activate

conda deactivate                       # Deactivate

#### Install required packages

2. Install the following dependencies via conda (pip commands are not working which provided on internet):

i. TensorFlow

   To install this package with conda run one of the following:

   conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow         ##### Use tensorflow==1.9
   conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken tensorflow
   conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 tensorflow 

ii. OpenCV

  To install this package with conda run one of the following:

  conda install -c conda-forge opencv
  conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 opencv
  conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken opencv
  conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 opencv 

iii. Keras

  To install this package with conda run one of the following:

  conda install -c conda-forge keras
  conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken keras
  conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 keras 

iv. ImageAI
 
  pip3 install imageai --upgrade     ##### pip install imageai --upgrade (this Pip Command Works fine Dont worry)


3) Download the RetinaNet model file that will be used for object detection via this link

https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5

# Paste this file and Image.jpg file in python working directories

# Creat python file in created environment (jupyter notebook)

# Open jupyter notebook from DeepLearning_cpu environment from anaconda power shell

  FinalDetection.py    # Name of my created file

# Run the following code for object detection

=========================================================================================================================================================================

  from imageai.Detection import ObjectDetection
  import os

  execution_path = os.getcwd()
  
  detector = ObjectDetection()
  detector.setModelTypeAsRetinaNet()
  detector.setModelPath( os.path.join(execution_path , "resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5"))
  detector.loadModel()
  detections = detector.detectObjectsFromImage(input_image=os.path.join(execution_path , "image.jpg"), output_image_path=os.path.join(execution_path , "imagenew.jpg"))

  for eachObject in detections:
      print(eachObject["name"] , " : " , eachObject["percentage_probability"] ) 

=========================================================================================================================================================================

# Check the file extension some times file extension will be jpeg and in progran we have jpg so error will occure .. so deal with it by giving same extension as 'image'.jpeg

# Same process works fine for linux operating system also
